*Intro*

This document provides essential information about
hardware used by this machine as well as basic
features of the programs and services used to
collect data from Auger SD stations deployed at
the Telescope Array (TA) cental laser facility (CLF).

=========================================

	2x Trendnet TU-S9 (Prolific 2303)
	1x FTDI FT232R

1x 128 GB Sandisk cruzer USB thumb drive

=========================================
OPERATING SYSTEM

Raspbian Jessie
Release date 2016-05-27
Version: May 2016
Permanent link: https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2016-05-31/
Kernel version: 4.4.13-v7+ #894 SMP Mon Jun 13 13:13:27 BST 2016 armv7l GNU/Linux

=========================================
SERIAL DEVICE CONFIGURATIONS

To determine the device numbers first look at /var/log/kern.log after
the system has booted. Separating the TA global trigger from the rest
is easy, as it's a different manufacturer. Distinguishing the Auger South
device from the TICTAC device might take some trial and error. There is only
one permutation to check of course: set the speed of one device and look
at the output. If nothing appears then it's the other Trendnet device you want.

1x TU-S9 for TA SD. Used for local trigger.
115200 8n1

1x TU-S9 for Auger South SD
38400 8n1

1x FTDI for TA global
115200 8n1

A text file containing full configurations is available in
auger_ta_svn/SBC_das/configs/ttyUSBX.txt

In this folder there are also two scripts for TA global and Auger South.
These require a few extra options since it's possible to send
in addition to receive. For the local trigger there is no physical
connection to the TX pins, so this isn't a concern.

=========================================
CANBUS DEVICE CONFIGRUATIONS

The machine is already setup to send and receive CAN messages. The Linux
kernel has all the necessary (and fortunately stable) socketcan drivers
built in.

To setup a CAN interface use
sudo /sbin/ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000

or use this command on the script in /home/pi

sudo ./open_can.sh

If a new machine needs to be installed the following config is necessary
for the current version of Raspbian

These edits should go at the end of the /boot/config.txt file
