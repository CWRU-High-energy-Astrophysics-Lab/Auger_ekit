  Original function can be found at: http://software.ligo.org/docs/glue/frames.html

  GPS time is basically measured in (atomic) seconds since  
  January 6, 1980, 00:00:00.0  (the GPS Epoch) 

  The GPS week starts on Saturday midnight (Sunday morning), and runs 
  for 604800 seconds.  

  Currently, GPS time is 17 seconds ahead of UTC
  While GPS SVs transmit this difference and the date when another leap 
  second takes effect, the use of leap seconds cannot be predicted.  This 
  routine is precise until the next leap second is introduced and has to be 
  updated after that.

  Note:  Python represents time in integer seconds, fractions are lost!!!
